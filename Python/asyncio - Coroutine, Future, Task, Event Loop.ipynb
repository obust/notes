    "Async is shorthand for *cooperative multitasking*, a style of multitasking where the currently running task does not get interrupted, but must yield control to other tasks (`Coroutine`). In the normal case, it may fire off request and then sleep until the request comes back with data (`Future`). During the time that it sleeps, other tasks may run and submit their requests in the same way.\n",
